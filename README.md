# AP Computer Science 2015 Free Response Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the Free Response questions of the [Advanced Placement Computer Science](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a) Exam for 2015.

A [copy of the exam questions](https://github.com/andrejewski/ap-compsci-2015/raw/master/exam.pdf?raw=true) is included in this repository.

The questions can also be found on College Board's website in [PDF format](https://securecontent.collegeboard.org/secure/ap/pdf/computer-science-a/ap15_frq_computer_science_a.pdf). Note: you will need to create an account to view the exam document.

## Questions

The questions are all answered within corresponding Java files in the `Solutions` folder. There are many correct solutions to these questions. The solutions presented are merely the most intuitive to myself. 

- Question 1: DiverseArray.java
- Question 2: HiddenWord.java
- Question 3: SparseArray.java
- Question 4: NumberGroup.java and Range.java

## Practice

As these questions now serve as study material for future tests, I have also included tests for each question that check the validity of your solutions. 

You may fork or clone this repository, write your own solutions, and simply run on your command-line:

```bash
# in the top directory
bash test.bash
```

Any problem in your code will throw an error.

All tests share the name of the class they test (i.e. DiverseArray has DiverseArrayTest).

## Contributing

If you find a problem, let me know. If a solution is incorrect or any test's coverage is poor, either open an issue or be awesome and pull that request.

I will not accept changes for syntax. However, if you find yourself with a more clear and concise solution to any of these problems, please let me know.

## The End

Duncan, Gabe, John, thanks for letting me attempt to teach you this stuff. This was one of the highlights of my senior year.
